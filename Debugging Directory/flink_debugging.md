# Debugging Apache Flink

## Tools and Techniques

1. **Web Interface**: Use Flink's web interface for monitoring and debugging.
2. **Logging**: Configure log levels and use log statements to track issues.
3. **Checkpointing**: Use checkpointing to ensure job state consistency.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Job Failures**: Check the web interface logs for error details.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the Flink cluster.
3. **Data Skew**: Use partitioning strategies to handle data skew.
